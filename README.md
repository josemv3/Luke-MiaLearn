# Luke-MiaLearn
Education app hub. Featuring miABC, miABCQuiz, miaTalks and more apps for learning. 

Early education and language development apps 
that grow with a user (children from 1-8 years old). 

Working with behavior specialists to limit gamification 
and distractions that make users less interested in the 
lesson and more interested in UI/UX. 

Using behavioral studies to create immersive lesson 
plans that are fun to learn. These lessons start with 
early ABC’s, colors, numbers, 1-3 word sentences, 
and fun quizzes to reinforce the previous lesson. 
The lessons grow to incorporate more complicated 
quizzes, lessons, and language development that 
models complete sentences and more. Each app 
will contain a starting package of 10 complete 
lessons, with 10 special needs alternatives. 
5 games will be in the starter package as well. 

Lesson apps include:

miABC - Introducing users to identify ABC’s, 
with alternative lessons in colors, numbers, 
shapes, toys, instruments, and more. 

miABCQuiz -  Users are scored by identifying 
ABC’s, colors, numbers, etc…

Mia Talks - Users learn 3-word sentences using 
nouns, adjectives, and verbs for early language 
development.

Learn with Luke - Users experience more complete 
lessons on subjects like the solar system, states, 
animals, and more. 

Find Me -  Users select objects that correspond to 
the lesson’s letter, and these objects are removed  to show what’s behind them. The object of the 
lesson is to find the toy that’s hiding behind the 
objects. 

Mia Talks 2 - Users learn more complicated sentences 
depending on their skill level, from 3 different animated 
avatars.

the behavioral team and will be listed when the content
